# Local AI Chatbot (Ollama)

This repository contains multiple chatbot implementations using **local Large Language Models (LLM)** powered by **Ollama**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- Local AI inference (offline, no API key)
- Streamlit UI development
- Backend architecture using FastAPI
- Clean separation between frontend and backend

---
